      As a kid, I dreamed of an all-powerful program that could create other
      computer programs. I never asked my mom for such software, assuming it
      must be incredibly expensive—after all, it would be the only program you'd
      ever need! In fifth grade, I stumbled upon my first <a
      href="https://cpp0x.pl/kursy/Kurs-C++/1">C++ programming tutorial</a>
      online. I was amazed that such a powerful tool was free to download, no
      torrents needed. However, after writing a few small programs, I quickly
      learned that pointers were challenging, and this "almighty" program felt
      almost useless in my novice hands. So, I returned to my computer games.

  <ng-template ev title="Second attempt at programming" startDate="2011-03-03" icon="mat:lightbulb_outline">
    <p>
      Several years ago, after an initial attempt at C++ programming didn't
      quite pan out, I decided to give programming another shot. Inspired by my
      hours spent playing the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3">classic Super
      Mario game</a> on my trusty 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP">GameBoy</a>, I
      set out to create my own platformer with a twist of logic puzzles. During
      this time, I discovered Java—a language touted for its object-oriented
      capabilities. I thought this meant I could easily display objects on a
      screen for my game. Imagine my surprise when I learned that
      object-oriented programming wasn't quite about visual objects. Eventually,
      I managed to write a program that encoded text using the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>,
      but my dream of developing a video game was stymied by my limited
      understanding of Java syntax. The final straw was my struggle to install
      the <a href="https://eclipseide.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>, leaving me to write
      code in Windows Notepad.

      My programming journey truly began at <a
      href="https://www.mechanik.rac.pl/" target="_blank">Technical High School
      "Mechanik"</a>, where I pursued an IT technician profile. During the first
      two years, I delved into the technical intricacies of computers, mastering
      the art of troubleshooting. Imagine the countless drivers I installed for
      stubborn network interfaces! Alongside, I tackled programming assignments
      and puzzles, learning the fundamentals of algorithmic complexity. While my
      custom version of bubble sort wasn't the most efficient, it remains a
      proud creation of mine. During my time there, I successfully passed three
      professional examinations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>E12 - Assembly and operation of personal computers and peripheral devices</li>
      <li>E13 - Designing local computer networks and network administration</li>
      <li>E14 - Creating web applications and databases, and administering databases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These experiences endowed me with practical skills, from cleaning up my
      laptop to configuring routers—indispensable for someone who spends a lot
      of time at the PC. My programming foundation was primarily in C++, where I
      explored features like operator overloading, classes, pointers, and
      advanced data structures such as lists and binary trees. I also developed
      several websites, acquiring most of my CSS knowledge along the way.
      Overall, my understanding of how computers work was significantly
      enhanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my third year, I embarked on a one-month internship. As one of the top
      students, I had the privilege of participating in the Erasmus+ student
      exchange program. Alongside my peers, I went to Brunswick, Germany, and
      worked at the PTS Institute. There, I learned the basics of programming
      microcontrollers and even developed my own clone of the classic <a

      Half of my education was leading up to this moment. I was thrilled to
      leave my parents' house and dive into fascinating subjects instead of dry
      literature. Reality, of course, had its own plans. First, I attended a
      different university from my high school friends, meaning I had to make
      new connections. Second, I faced a cultural shock with the formal approach
      to mathematics. I vividly recall my bewilderment when my first task was to
      prove that one does not equal zero. Yet, after the initial surprise, I
      quickly adapted to a system where every theorem demanded proof. To this
      day, I cherish elegant mathematical proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the fundamentals of mathematics under my belt, I moved on to more
      technical classes where programming basics were introduced. I got my hands
      dirty with C and Java and learned techniques for proving algorithm
      correctness. Although proving imperative algorithms with <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">loop invariants</a>
      was a bit tedious compared to induction, it was a valuable learning
      experience. I also tackled <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design
      patterns</a>. While memorizing them all felt like an arduous task, their
      utility is undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth semester brought an unexpected turn with the COVID-19 pandemic
      hitting Poland, pushing us into remote learning. Initially, a two-week
      break was welcomed, but soon it was back to assignments. During this
      period, I expanded my knowledge with Prolog, metaheuristic algorithms,
      topology, and even ventured into less thrilling subjects like computer
      graphics and web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, my university experience was fantastic. I made lasting
      friendships and developed a deep love for mathematics. The Headmaster's
      scholarship was a nice bonus that kept my budget intact.

      Moving to a new town can be challenging, especially when you're a math
      enthusiast like me. In search of like-minded friends, I found my way to
      the local science club. Honestly, the promise of post-club pizza was a
      significant factor in my decision. Although I wasn't initially captivated
      by functional programming and formal methods, I joined the "Lambda"
      science club.
    </p>
    <p>
        The club's primary goal at first was to teach newcomers, myself included,
        the COQ proof assistant. Over time, I also delved into Haskell and Rust,
        which have since become two of my favorite programming languages. It was
        here that I developed a passion for functional programming, particularly
        for its strict type systems that help catch errors early in the
        development process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, our club still meets almost every Wednesday to discuss the latest
        advancements in type theory.

      During my third year, I had the opportunity to join the prestigious Quant
      Scholarship Program at Credit Suisse. After successfully passing the
      entrance exam and interview, I was accepted into the program. The
      curriculum was divided into two main components. The first focused on
      financial mathematics, where I gained a deep understanding of the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model">Black-Scholes
      model</a>, learned to value European and American options, and explored
      other valuation methods such as the Monte Carlo method. The second
      component concentrated on the F# language. As part of the program, I
      developed a <a href="https://github.com/marek-bauer/Option-pricer">simple
      F# application</a> to value various financial instruments, which I
      presented as my final project.

      To complete my studies, I needed to undertake an internship. Since I
      couldn't find an internship that piqued my interest, I decided to work
      part-time as a software developer. After applying to several companies, I
      chose a position at Siemens due to their strong market presence. Following
      a brief introduction and a health and safety course, I got a taste of what
      it's like to work as a programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, the vast codebase was overwhelming. However, I quickly learned
      that starting with smaller tasks was more manageable than diving into
      large chunks of code. I enjoyed my role at Siemens because it offered a
      variety of projects, from small to mid-sized. During my year and a half
      there, I worked on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing a native Android application for a logistics center</li>
      <li>Creating an Ionic application for a postal company</li>
      <li>Building a Java GWT application to manage a logistics center</li>
      <li>Developing a tool for Android test automation</li>
      <li>Creating a Spring application for managing luggage transfer at a small airport</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My time at Siemens was a fantastic journey that significantly shaped my
      skills as a programmer. I cherish the memories of working with a great
      team. However, when I received a job offer to work with Haskell, I decided
      to seize that incredible opportunity and move on.

    <p>
      My dissertation explored the challenge of generating true random numbers
      on a deterministic machine, inspired by my fascination with probability
      theory. Initially, I considered various approaches, such as developing a
      game where user behavior would generate entropy or using a public API.
      However, these methods posed significant testing challenges. Ultimately, I
      chose to use website response times as my entropy source. Although this
      approach also had practical limitations, it provided invaluable insights
      into testing randomness and contributed to my successful graduation. I
      view this experience as a meaningful achievement.
