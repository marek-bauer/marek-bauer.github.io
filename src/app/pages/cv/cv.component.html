      As a kid, I always dreamed about an all-powerful and almighty program that
      could be used to create other computer programs. However, I didn't ask my
      mum for such a program since I assumed it must be super expensive, as it
      would be the only program you would ever need. When I was in fifth grade,
      I found my first <a href="https://cpp0x.pl/kursy/Kurs-C++/1">tutorial</a>
      on programming in C++ on the internet. I could not believe that such a
      powerful tool was free to download, even without using torrents. However,
      after writing some small programs, I realized that pointers are hard, and
      this all-powerful and almighty program was, in reality, an almost useless
      tool in my hands. So I went back to playing computer games.

  <ng-template ev title="Second attempt at programming" startDate="2011-03-03" icon="mat:lightbulb_outline">
    <p>
      A couple of years after my failed attempt at being a C++ programmer, I
      decided to give programming a second try. At this time, I was playing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3">classic Super Mario game</a> 
      on my 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP">GameBoy</a>,
      so I was determined to write my own platforming game with the addition of
      logic puzzles. Meanwhile, I learned about the existence of the Java
      language, which was advertised to me as an object-oriented language, and
      since I wanted to make a window app, displaying objects seemed like a good
      idea. You can imagine my disappointment when I realized that
      object-oriented programming is not the same as displaying objects on the
      screen. In the end, I was able to write a program to encode text in 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>
      , but I gave up on my great video game idea since I didn't understand half
      of the Java syntax. The nail in my Java coffin was that I failed to
      install <a href="https://eclipseide.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>, so I was
      writing my programs in Windows Notepad.

  <ng-template ev title="Technical High School" startDate="2014-09-01" endDate="2018-05-22" icon="mat:school">
    <p>
      My real journey with programming started at <a
      href="https://www.mechanik.rac.pl/">Technical High School "Mechanik"</a>
      where I started my next educational stage in the IT technician profile. In
      the first and second years, the focus was on the technical aspects of how
      computers work and how to fix them. You can only imagine how many drivers
      for non-working network interfaces I needed to install. But there were
      also programming assignments and puzzles. I learned the basics of
      algorithmic complexity, so I learned why my custom version of bubble sort
      is not the best sorting algorithm ever. However, I am still proud of my
      version. During my education there, I passed 3 professional examinations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>E12 - Assembly and operation of personal computers and peripheral devices</li>
      <li>E13 - Designing local computer networks and network administration</li>
      <li>E14 - Creating web applications and databases, and administering databases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So I have basic knowledge of how to clean up my laptop and configure a
      router, which is quite useful when you spend most of your life in front of
      a PC. My programming journey at this stage was mostly in the C++ language.
      I learned most of its features, such as overloading operators, classes,
      pointers, and even more advanced data structures like lists and binary
      trees. I developed multiple websites, and most of my CSS knowledge was
      obtained there. Overall, my knowledge of how computers work was greatly
      improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my third year, I was obligated to do a one-month internship.
      Fortunately, as one of the best students at my high school, I qualified
      for the Erasmus+ student exchange program. Together with my friends, I was
      sent to Brunswick, Germany, where we worked at the PTS Institute. This is
      where I learned the basics of programming microcontrollers, and I even
      developed my own clone of the <a href='https://github.com/marek-bauer/Snake'>
      Snake game</a> for <a href='https://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a>.

    <p>
      This was the moment I was preparing for during half of my education. I was
      really excited to move out of my parents' house and start to learn really
      interesting subjects, instead of some boring literature. The reality was
      slightly different. The first problem was that I went to a different
      university than my friends from high school, so I needed to find new
      friends. The second was the cultural shock from the formal approach to
      mathematics. I still remember my confusion when my first task was to prove
      that one is not equal to zero. However, after the initial shock, I quite
      quickly adjusted to this system where every theorem needed to have a
      proof, and to this day I love nice mathematical proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After learning the basics of mathematics, there were more technical
      classes where we learned the basics of programming. I learned the basics
      of C and Java languages and techniques of proving algorithm correctness.
      Unfortunately, those were imperative algorithms, so I needed to find some
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">loop
      invariants</a>, which was annoying since proving something by induction is
      way easier. I was also forced to learn some <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design
      patterns</a>, which can be useful, but learning them all by heart was
      inhumane torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in my fourth semester, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Poland, and we
      were forced to start learning remotely. At first, it was nice to have 2
      weeks off, but after that, I needed to start doing assignments. During the
      pandemic, I learned Prolog, metaheuristic algorithms, topology, and some
      less fun subjects like computer graphics and web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I had a great time at my university. I made a lot of friends and
      started to really love mathematics. I was even a recipient of the
      Headmaster's scholarship, so my budget was not affected.

    <p>
      As a new guy in town, I needed to find friends, and for weird guy who
      loves math, there is no better place to do so than a science club. So I
      decided to become a member of one. To be honest, my choice was based
      mostly on the after-club activity of eating pizza. So despite the fact
      that at the moment I was not that interested in functional programming and
      formal methods, I became a member of the "Lambda" science club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main focus of the club at the beginning was teaching new members,
      including me, the COQ proof assistant. Later, I also learned Haskell and
      Rust, two of my favorite programming languages. This was the place where I
      started to love functional programming for its strict type systems, which
      help you catch most of the stupidest errors before you even start your
      program.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this day we meet almost every Wednesday to talk about new developments
      in type theory.

    <p>
      In my third year, I decided to enroll in the Quant Scholarship Program by
      Credit Suisse. After an entrance exam and interview, I was accepted. This
      program focused on two components. The first component was financial
      mathematics, where I learned how the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model">Black-Scholes
      model</a> works, how to value European and American options, and other
      valuation methods like the Monte Carlo method. The second component was
      focused on the F# language. To graduate from this program, I prepared a <a
      href="https://github.com/marek-bauer/Option-pricer">simple F# program
      valuing various financial instruments</a>.

    <p>
      In order to graduate from my studies, I needed to do some internship.
      Since I could not find an interesting internship offer, I decided to start
      working as a part-time software developer. I applied for a couple of
      positions but finally decided that a position at Siemens was the best one
      due to their position in the market. After a short introduction and health
      and safety course, I was able to learn what working as a programmer looks
      like. At first, I was a bit overwhelmed by the size of the codebase. But I
      quickly figured out that it is best to start working on some small tasks
      instead of scrolling through large chunks of code. I liked my position for
      the variety of different middle-sized to small projects. During my one and
      a half years there, I worked on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Native Android application for a logistics center</li>
      <li>Ionic application for a postal company</li>
      <li>Java GWT application for managing a logistics center</li>
      <li>Developing a tool for Android test automation</li>
      <li>Developing a Spring application for managing luggage transfer for a small airport</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Working at Siemens was a great journey that shaped me as a programmer. I
      remember it fondly as being part of a great team, but after getting a job
      position in Haskell, I decided to move on since I could not waste that
      opportunity.

  <ng-template ev title='Bachelor of Science dissertation' startDate="2021-12-12" icon="fab:github">
    <p>
      My dissertation was based on the problem of generating true random numbers
      on a deterministic machine, stemming from my fascination with probability
      theory at the time. At the beginning, I considered multiple approaches to
      this problem, such as developing a game in which user behavior would be
      the source of entropy or using a public API for that. However, both
      approaches would be hard to test for their validity. So I decided to use
      the response time of websites as my source of entropy. In the end, this
      approach also had a lot of problems which made it impractical. However, I
      learned a lot about how to test randomness and I was able to graduate, so 
      I consider this as a success.
