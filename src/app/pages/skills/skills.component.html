      <p>
        Haskell is one of my favorite programming languages. I was introduced
        to it during my studies, but my real adventure with Haskell began when I
        joined Standard Chartered Bank. At the bank, we use a custom dialect of
        Haskell called Mu. Although I'm well-versed in Mu, I may be less familiar
        with some of the newer features in standard Haskell, as they are not
        available in Mu.

      <p>
        I have professionally worked with Java for 1.5 years, primarily
        developing Android applications. During this time, I prepared for the
        Oracle Certified Associate exam, giving me a solid understanding of the
        language's features and challenges, at least up to its 8th version.

      [tags]="[ 'Academic experience', 'Professional experience', 'Imperative', 
                'Numpy', 'Machine learning']">
      <p>
        Python is my go-to scripting language for both personal and professional
        projects. Throughout my studies, I leveraged Python to tackle
        basics machine learning projects.

      <p>
        Rust is one of my favorite programming languages due to its innovative
        approach to memory management. I also appreciate its functional flavor
        in an imperative language. While I haven't worked on a professional
        project in Rust yet, I've developed several small Rust projects during
        my studies.

      [aliases]="['TS']">
      <p>
        I mastered this language to work with the Angular framework while
        developing an Ionic application for Siemens. Its powerful type system,
        which surpasses that of most statically typed languages, significantly
        simplified my workflow.

      [tags]="['Formal methods', 'Reliable systems', 'Dependent types', 'Type theory']">
      <p>
        COQ is a proof assistant based on type theory, which I explored in my
        master's thesis. With COQ, I can prove properties of algorithms and
        inductive types, although I find co-inductive types more challenging.

      <p>
        JavaScript and I have a unique relationship. I'm captivated by its
        ability to create dynamic, interactive web applications, yet there are
        quirks that can be frustrating. For example, the name "JavaScript" was
        picked to ride on the coattails of Java's success, and its loose type
        system can be baffling at times (where else can 1 + 1 sometimes equal
        11?).
