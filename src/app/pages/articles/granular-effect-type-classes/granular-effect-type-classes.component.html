<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Some time ago, I was wondering if for functions with IO effects I should write
  it as <code-line lang="Haskell" code="fn :: a -> IO b"></code-line> or as
  <code-line lang="Haskell" code="fn :: MonadIO m => a -> m b"></code-line>.
  Both approaches have some advantages. The first one is more straightforward,
  therefore easier to read, and the second one is more flexible, but at the cost
  of potentially having more confusing error messages. At the time, I didn't see
  that both approaches were wrong in many aspects. Let me introduce you to
  granular effect monad type classes. The granular effect monad type class is
  simply a type class that supports a single effect like writing to the terminal,
  reading from the terminal, or fetching data from a database.
</p>

<h3>Why Use Granular Effect Monad Type Classes?</h3>

<p>
  The problem with the <code-line lang="Haskell" code="MonadIO"></code-line>
  type class is that the set of IO effects is too big and it handles all
  communications with the outside world. And not all communications are made
  equal. Let's take an example of the effect of randomness. We want to define a
  function that randomly selects one element from a list. It isn't
  deterministic, so it cannot be pure. It needs a seed from the real world, so
  most likely it would get defined as <code-line lang="Haskell" code="selectRand
  :: MonadIO m => [a] -> m a"></code-line>. But it is overkill to use the
  all-mighty <code-line lang="Haskell" code="MonadIO"></code-line> to randomly
  select an element of a list. In such cases, the correct (in my opinion)
  approach is to define a new type class that gives us randomness.
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'class Monad m => MonadRand m where'
  , '  selectRand :: [a] -> m a'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  For such a type class, we can easily define an instance for the <code-line
  lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> monad. Constraints are by definition
  easy to compose, so there is no problem with having a function that uses
  multiple effects, e.g., <code-line lang="Haskell" 
  code="func :: (MonadRand m, MonadPrint m, MonadFetch m) => m Result"></code-line>.
</p>

<div class="frame" frame-name="Problem with Overlapping Instance">
  You might be tempted to define an instance using <code-line lang="Haskell" code="MonadIO"></code-line>:

  <code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
    [ 'instance MonadIO m => MonadRand m where'
    ]"></code-block>

  This, however, requires the <code-line lang=""
  code="UndecidableInstances"></code-line> extension and generates future
  problems with overlapping if we want to define other instances for this type
  class. So it is not a recommended approach.  
</div>

<div class="frame" frame-name="This is NOT a Case Against IO Monad">
  I am not proposing dropping <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line>
  entirely. In my opinion, <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> has
  the advantage of being really easy to use, in contrast to some more advanced
  effect monads. Monad <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> can be a
  perfectly good instance for granular effect monad type classes. This approach
  does not force us into using granular effect monads like old Purescript's
  <code-line lang="Haskell" code="Eff"></code-line>.
</div>

<h3>Code Optimization</h3>

<p>
  I personally believe that the introduction of <code-line lang="Haskell"
  code="IO"></code-line> monad is the selling point in Haskell. In the
  beginning, it might seem like a good idea to use <code-line lang="Haskell"
  code="MonadIO"></code-line> everywhere, but as the codebase grows, it becomes
  harder to manage. Granular effect monad type classes provide a way to
  structure the code better and make it more maintainable.
</p>

<p>
  By using granular effect monad type classes, we can achieve better code
  optimization and separation of concerns. Each effect can be handled
  independently, making the code more modular and easier to test.
</p>

<p>
  In conventional imperative languages like Python, Java, or C++, you can never be
  sure if used functions have some effects or not. This makes the lives of
  programmers and compilers harder, since we often need to look into the code to
  know if the function is pure or not. This is annoying and sometimes impossible
  when the language is only an interface for a library written in C (yes, I am
  talking about you, Python). For example, you see a function like this:
</p>

<code-block lang="Python" [code]="
  [ 'def example(a, b, c):'
  , '  d = function(a, b)'
  , '  if c and d:'
  , '    print(\'something\')'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  Looks like an obvious place for optimization, right? Why not simply take
  advantage of lazy evaluation of <code-line lang="Python"
  code="or"></code-line>? 
</p>

<p>
  But what if <code-line lang="Python" code="function(a, b)"></code-line> has
  some side effects? Let's rewrite the code to make it more explicit:
</p>

<code-block lang="Python" [code]="
  [ 'def write_to_file(file_name, text, show_confirmation): '
  , '  writing_successful = write_to_file(file_name, text)'
  , '  if show_confirmation and writing_successful:'
  , '    print \'Successfully written to file\''
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  Now it looks like an obviously bad idea to make such an optimization. We all
  agree that depending on function names to know if optimization is correct or
  not is a slippery slope, and in practice, it will one day cause some unexpected
  bugs after code refactoring. Haskell solves this by making a clear type
  distinction between <code-line lang="Haskell" code="equals :: String ->
  String -> Bool"></code-line> and <code-line lang="Haskell" code="writeToFile
  :: String -> String -> IO Bool"></code-line>. Thanks to this invention, we
  don't need to trust other programmers that functions that sound like pure
  functions are indeed pure.
</p>

<p>
  By using granular effect monad type classes, we can make our code even more
  predictable and maintainable. Each effect is explicitly stated in the type
  signature, making it easier to understand and reason about the code. Some
  effects, like writing to a file, change the state of the "real world" and some
  do not. An example of the second group is fetching some data from a database
  or checking if a file exists or not. Usually, in Haskell, they also use the
  same monad <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line>. Let's see some
  examples:
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'example :: String -> Bool -> IO ()'
  , 'example fileName show = do'
  , '  exists <- fileExists fileName'
  , '  if show && exists'
  , '    then putStrLn fileExistsMsg'
  , '    else pure ()'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  In this case, we see that this is sub-optimal since there is no point in
  checking the existence of a file if we do not want to show the message to the
  user. But we cannot deduce this based only on the type of functions. Therefore,
  it is crucial to introduce more granular effect monad classes.
</p>

<h3>More Information is Always a Win</h3>

<p>
  In the previous section, we saw why we need at least two types of monad classes
  to be able to optimize code without changing its semantics. However, code
  optimization is not the only place where more information about function
  effects is helpful.
</p>

<div class="frame" frame-name="Ignoring Unwanted Effects">
  It is often the case that we do not always care about the effects that the
  function is producing. For example, the effect of writing to the screen in
  <code-line lang="Haskell" code="compute :: (MonadLog m) => Double -> m
  Double"></code-line>. This function wants to write something to the screen, but
  if we don't need this feature, we can make it pure by ignoring all writing
  actions. Obviously, there is no way of ignoring <code-line lang="Haskell"
  code="putStrLn"></code-line> and escaping <code-line lang="Haskell"
  code="IO"></code-line>.
</div>

<div class="frame" frame-name="Better Environment Definition">
  The <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> monad does not provide much
  information about what is actually required to run correctly. By introducing
  granular effect type classes, we can see that we cannot run <code-line
  lang="Haskell" code="fetchUsers :: (MonadDB m) => m [User]"></code-line>
  without first starting the database.
</div>

<div class="frame" frame-name="Easier Debugging">
  Due to the fact that we are able to better track the effects of each function,
  the debugging process is much easier. For example, if we have a problem with a
  function that prints invalid messages to the screen, we are able to narrow down
  the search to functions with writing effects instead of checking all functions
  with the <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> monad.
</div>

<h3>Effortless Testable Code</h3>

<p>
  In my opinion, the greatest advantage of using granular effect type classes is
  the ability to test your code without any changes. Let's see an example of a
  simple echo function:
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'echo :: IO ()'
  , 'echo = do'
  , '  line <- getLine'
  , '  putStrLn line'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  How can we test it? It uses <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line>
  and we can't mock the <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> monad, or at
  least it isn't easy. The alternative definition is <code-line lang="Haskell"
  code="echo :: MonadIO m => m ()"></code-line>, which is also untestable since we would
  need to mock <code-line lang="Haskell" code="liftIO :: MonadIO m => IO a ->
  m a"></code-line>, which is as hard as mocking the original function. If we use
  two granular type classes:
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'class Monad m => MonadRead m where'
  , '  getLine :: m String'
  , ''
  , 'class Monad m => MonadPrint m where'
  , '  putLine :: String -> m ()'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  We can redefine the echo function as follows:
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'echo :: (MonadRead m, MonadPrint m) => m ()'
  , 'echo = do'
  , '  line <- getLine'
  , '  putLine line'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  Now we can mock the effect using a testing monad:
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'newtype TerminalTest a'
  , '  = TerminalTest { unTerminalTest :: RWS () [String] [String] a }'
  , '  deriving (Monad, Applicative, Functor)'
  , ''
  , 'runTerminalTest :: [String] -> TerminalTest a -> (a, [String], [String])'
  , 'runTerminalTest input (TerminalTest t) = runRWS t () input'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  With the following instances:
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'instance MonadRead TerminalTest where'
  , '  getLine = TerminalTest $ do'
  , '    (i : is) <- get'
  , '    put is -- dropping used element'
  , '    pure i'
  , ''
  , 'instance MonadPrint TerminalTest where '
  , '  putLine = TerminalTest . tell . pure'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  Now we can test our echo function without any issues. This same approach can
  be used to mock connections to external resources like databases or REST
  endpoints.
</p>

<h3>Iterative Refactoring Effort</h3>

<p>
  Transitioning to granular effect type classes can be done in small steps. If
  we define a new function, we can define it in terms of granular effect type
  classes, and without any problem use it in a main function that requires
  <code-line lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> effect as long as <code-line
  lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> is an instance of your effect type
  classes.
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'newStep :: MonadPrint m => Int -> m ()'
  , 'newStep x = ...'
  , ''
  , 'main :: IO ()'
  , 'main = do '
  , '  someStep'
  , '  newStep 1 -- IO will be used here automatically'
  ]"></code-block>

<p>
  If your function uses a function with <code-line
  lang="Haskell" code="IO"></code-line> effect, you would need to include
  <code-line lang="Haskell" code="MonadIO"></code-line> as one of the effects
  until this function is refactored.
</p>

<code-block lang="Haskell" [code]="
  [ 'newStep\' :: (MonadPrint m, MonadIO m) => String -> m ()'
  , 'newStep\' x = do'
  , '  y <- liftIO (oldStep :: IO String)'
  , '  ...'
  ]"></code-block>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  Granular effect type classes make your code easier to maintain and test. The
  refactoring can be done in small steps. The only downside is the requirement of
  creating those type classes. However, the effort is minimal compared to the vast
  benefits of using them.
